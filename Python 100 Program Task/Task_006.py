# program006:

# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the
# given formula:

# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]

# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a
# comma-separated sequence.

# Example
# Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence
# is given to the program:
# 100,150,180

# The output of the program should be:
# 18,22,24

# Hints:
# If the output received is in decimal form,
# it should be rounded off to its nearest value
# (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26)
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.

    Calculate the value of Q for a given list of D values using the formula:

    Parameters:
    d_values (list of int): A list of integer values representing D.

    Returns:
    list of int: A list of integers representing the calculated Q values, rounded to the nearest whole number.

    Note:
    - The constants C and H must be defined in the global scope for this function to work.
    - The `math` module must be imported to use the `math.sqrt` function.
